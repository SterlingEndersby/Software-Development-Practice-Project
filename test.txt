SE 407707 GitHub Tutorial
2015

// Work out how to add a text file in the local repository.
Here's the test text file

// Make some changes to the file.
I propose we add our names:
Jaimes has added his name to test making a change and pushing it
to GitHub.
Patrick has added his name to test making a change and pushing it
to GitHub.

// Commit the new version of it to your local repository

// Push the new version to to the cloud Git repository

// Pull the latest version of files to your local repository

// Merge changes with the cloud Git repository and resolve any conflicts
Let's make a conflict here and have to merge to resolve it.
